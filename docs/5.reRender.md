# 5. Re-render libraries
It's nice to be able to customize the baked decal, but what happens to your existing collections? Well there is 
feature in the Re-render tab of the addon!

Select the library you want to re-render, click the re-render button and DM Customizer will use its settings to update all the thumbnails of the selected 
library.
