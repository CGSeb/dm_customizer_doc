# 2. Installation

With DECALMachine installed (read <a href="https://machin3.io/DECALmachine/docs/" target="_blank">their doc</a> to install it), 
you can install DM Customizer.

There is no specific installation process, you can install it like any other Blender addon.

!!! info
    We do recommend downloading the zip file from where you bought the addon and directly import it into blender. 
    Unzipping the file is unnecessary
